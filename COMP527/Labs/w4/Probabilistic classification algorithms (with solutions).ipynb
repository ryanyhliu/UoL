    "In this tutorial we will implement a Naive Bayes classifier for text classification. More specifically, the aim of the classifier is to predict whether a given product review is positive or negative.\n",

    "We will represent documents (i.e. product reviews) as vectors of binary features. For each [unigram or bigram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) that appears in at least one document in our training dataset we introduce a binary feature. For a given document a feature is 1 if the documents contains the corresponding unigram/bigram, and it is 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets are contained in four files ('test.negative', 'test.positive', 'train.negative', 'train.positive'). The files correspond to product reviews from the test and train datasets labelled positively or negatively. For example, the file 'test.negative' contains negative product reviews from the test dataset.\n",

    "The reviews are preprocessed and expressed as a list of unigrams and bigrams without duplications (for a bigram (w1,w2), the corresponding record is w1__w2). Each review is represented as a single line and features (unigrams and bigrams) extracted from that review are listed space delimited. Take a moment to inspect the content of the dataset files."
